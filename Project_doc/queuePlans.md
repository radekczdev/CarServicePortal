## Implementation of queue (to be decided): ##
Given:
- queue has all **RepairOrders** in _Queue_
   - queue has its own calendar (maybe *google calendar*?)
- repair order has types
- for all types there is estimated time

To be decided:
- working date for order will be reserved in google calendar  
    * automatically assign term according to input data  
    OR
    * show free terms (from *google calendar*)
        - closest to today
        - between dates
